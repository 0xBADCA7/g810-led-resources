Sets effect to 'breathing' with color rgb(252,253,254) at the highest level the slider bar offers. Noticed that the full cycle of updates after switching to the profile (which was done through linking a profile to Notepad++ and letting logitech automatically send the profile once) is around 1 second for fullspeed, 5 seconds for midspeed, and a long 10 seconds for nospeed.

Idle g810 capture, was getting periodic updates without having anything interesting going on. Not sure why

Sets effect to 'fixedcolor' - believe this was also at rgb(252,253,254). The second one includes going to the window and back, where it loads the profile and then reloads the former profile.
